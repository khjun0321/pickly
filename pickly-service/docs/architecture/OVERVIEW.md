# Pickly Architecture Overview

## System Architecture

Pickly is designed as a microservices-based social recommendation platform with the following key components:

### Frontend Applications
- **Mobile App**: Flutter-based native mobile application
- **Web App**: React-based responsive web application
- **Admin Dashboard**: Administrative interface for content management

### Backend Services
- **API Gateway**: Main REST API server handling all client requests
- **Authentication Service**: User authentication and authorization
- **Notification Service**: Push notifications and real-time messaging
- **Upload Service**: File upload and media processing

### Infrastructure
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for primary data storage
- **Cache**: Redis for session management and caching
- **Storage**: AWS S3 for file and media storage
- **Queue**: Message queue for async processing

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **Mobile**: Flutter with Riverpod state management
- **Web**: React with Zustand and React Query
- **UI**: Material Design system with shared component library

### Backend
- **Runtime**: Node.js with TypeScript
- **Framework**: Fastify for high-performance APIs
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT with refresh token rotation

### DevOps & Infrastructure
- **Containerization**: Docker and Docker Compose
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions
- **Infrastructure**: Terraform for IaC
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus and Grafana

## Data Flow

1. **User Interaction**: Users interact through mobile or web clients
2. **API Gateway**: All requests route through the main API service
3. **Authentication**: JWT tokens validate user sessions
4. **Business Logic**: Services process requests and apply business rules
5. **Data Persistence**: PostgreSQL stores structured data
6. **File Storage**: S3 handles media and file uploads
7. **Real-time Updates**: WebSocket connections for live features

## Security

- **Authentication**: Multi-factor authentication support
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Data Protection**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **API Security**: Rate limiting and request validation
- **Privacy**: GDPR compliance and data anonymization

## Scalability

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Stateless services with load balancing
- **Database Sharding**: Partitioned data for large datasets
- **CDN**: Global content delivery for static assets
- **Caching Strategy**: Multi-level caching for performance
- **Auto-scaling**: Kubernetes HPA for dynamic scaling

## Development Workflow

- **Monorepo Structure**: Centralized codebase with Melos
- **SPARC Methodology**: Systematic development approach
- **Test-Driven Development**: Comprehensive testing strategy
- **Code Quality**: ESLint, Prettier, and automated checks
- **Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs and guides
